# Project One

Hypothesis: We believe that overall air quality, measured by Air Quality Index (AQI), has improved worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis and will explore this theme by researching data on air quality indexes before COVID-19 and throughout the crisis. In regions where the public health response has been strict, enacting policies such as travel bans and lockdowns, we expect to see improved levels of air quality. Conversely, regions that enacted less strict responses, we believe that air quality indexes will have improved at a lower rate. We also want to explore how air quality impacts the rate of infection, expecting to see a strong positive correlation of rates of infection(deaths) in regions with poorer air quality.
